    <H1>Potato<H1>
            <H2>Best food in the world</H2>

            <p>The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial Solanum tuberosum of the Solanaceae family.
                Potato plants are herbaceous perennials that grow about 60 cm (24 in) high, depending on variety,
                with the leaves dying back after flowering, fruiting and tuber formation. They bear white, pink, red,
                blue, or purple flowers with yellow stamens.
                The potato was first domesticated in the region of modern-day Peru and Bolivia between 10,000 and 7,000
                years ago.
                It has since spread around the world and become a staple crop in many countries.</p>
            <p>Potatoes are mostly grown in temperate climates, but they can also be grown in colder climates such as in
                Finland and Canada.
                The potato plant is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to about 60 cm (24 in) in height. The
                leaves are alternate, simple,
                and typically measure 10-25 cm (4-10 in) in length. The flowers are small, white, pink, red, blue, or
                purple, and have six petals.
                The potato is a starchy tuber that typically measures 3-10 cm (1-4 in) in diameter and 7-30 cm (3-12 in)
                in length.</p>

            <div class="harvesting"><b>Harvesting</b></div>
            <p>At harvest time, gardeners usually dig up potatoes with a long-handled, three-prong "grape" (or graip),
                i.e., a spading fork, or a potato hook, which is similar to the graip but with tines at a 90° angle to
                the handle. In larger plots, the plow is the fastest implement for unearthing potatoes. Commercial
                harvesting is typically done with large potato harvesters, which scoop up the plant and surrounding
                earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which
                separates some of the dirt. The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs. Different
                designs use different systems at this point. The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers,
                along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past
                workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are
                continuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes
                are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage.</p>
            <p>Potatoes are usually cured after harvest to improve skin-set. Skin-set is the process by which the skin
                of the potato becomes resistant to skinning damage. Potato tubers may be susceptible to skinning at
                harvest and suffer skinning damage during harvest and handling operations. Curing allows the skin to
                fully set and any wounds to heal. Wound-healing prevents infection and water-loss from the tubers during
                storage. Curing is normally done at relatively warm temperatures (10 to 16 °C or 50 to 60 °F) with high
                humidity and good gas-exchange if at all possible.</p>
